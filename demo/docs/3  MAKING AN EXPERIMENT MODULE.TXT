To make a new module, do the following:

* create a new .py file in this directory and name it appropriately (say: yourmodule.py)

* In the file, define a class called Main, and derive from either framework.tickmodule.TickModule or 
  from framework.latentmodule.LatentModule. Your module should now be recognized by the framework (i.e.
  it will not crash when you execute launcher.py --module=yourmodule)

  If your module is even remotely complex, you are better off by deriving from LatentModule, and following
  the instructions there. You may want to copy and paste from an existing module. Now is the best time to 
  read the tutorial for Panda3d (on the web) to get started.

* You might want to put your module into a sub-directory, especially if you are planning to write multiple modules for your study.
